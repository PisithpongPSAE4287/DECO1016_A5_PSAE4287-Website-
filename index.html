    <p>With the world evolving at an incredible pace, the ongoing destruction of the sloth’s natural habitat has caused a steep decrease in its population. At this on-going rate, sloths will become extinct in the very near future.</p>

    <p>
      The total population of sloths had been expected to vanish by the year 2022. Though the numbers are drastically decreasing, there has been very little to no accomplishment done by humans to slow down the rate. Within the past decade, it has been found that the population has gone down by as much as 80%. Moreover, this means that there is only about 20% left of the numbers of sloths left (Christina, n.d.). Sloths are found to have an average life expectancy between 20 to 30 years of age. The short life expectancy of the species also leads to the limited amount of years for them to breed. Due to the sloths’ habitat of only being able to produce offspring at the most of one, it limits the chance for them to raise and maintain their population number. Depending on the species, the gestate period can take anywhere from around four months to as long as 11 months (The Animal Files, n.d.). Given that they take the stated period of time, producing an offspring would already cost them up to 5% of their entire life time. Therefore, destroying the sloths natural habitat would eliminate the possibility of them growing a bigger population all together.

      Throughout history there have been countless animals that have gone extinct and sloths will not be any different if no effort is put into helping them which will mean that history is going to repeat itself again. With the human population increasing over time, more space for humans is going to be required for housing, commerce, and agriculture (Elizabeth, 2019). This leads to further deforestation as well as destroying the animals’ habitat. For the sloths, their natural habitat is shrinking at a faster rate than ever which makes it more difficult for them to survive. Not only does deforestation cause the sloths to lose their natural habitat, it also leads to other concerning factors such as the loss of shelter and food supply. While some animals are able to adapt to the changes that humans have created overtime, other animals that do not adapt will go extinct (The Sloth Conservation Foundation, 2020). At the very least, if there are restrictions to limit people from expanding living areas, cutting down trees, and burning the forest then there is a higher possibility and hope for sloths to survive for a longer period of time. Overall, the main reason that animals go extinct is because of the things that the humans have done to the planet Earth.
